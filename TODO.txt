BUG:

When trying to run multiple virtual_* passes over a method:
The first one works fine.

But then the second one tries to use method_source to get the source of the
method to virtualize. However, method_source gives it the code in the file,
BEFORE it was modified by the first virtual_*, producing wrong results.

To fix this, after each pass with a virtual_*, save a copy of the modified sexp
and use that as the starting point for the next go.
